# Mobile Games A/B Testing Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the results of an A/B test conducted in a mobile game to compare retention rates between two versions of the game (control and test). The goal is to determine whether the changes in Version B positively impacted user retention.

## Key Findings
- **Day 1 Retention**: No significant difference between the control and test groups.
- **Day 7 Retention**: Significant improvement in the test group, indicating that Version B is more effective at retaining users long-term.

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Statistical analysis using `scipy`

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to reproduce the analysis.

## Conclusion
The A/B test shows that Version B significantly improves user retention after 7 days. We recommend rolling out Version B to all users.
